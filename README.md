1. dummy_g.py - gaussian model
2. dummy_gmm.py - gaussian mixture model
3. dummy_t.py - t distribution model
4. dummy_fact.py - factor analysis model
5. utils.py - to import data
6. etxract.py - to annotate and get images from FDDB dataset; this mostly won't work in your system due to absence of the annotation files, images, path of the directory issues.
